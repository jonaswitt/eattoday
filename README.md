# What Should We Eat Today?

What Should We Eat Today? is a service that helps to collect recipes / ideas for cooking at home (and later, restaurants for eating out). These ideas can be voted on by whoever you're cooking/eating with, and the service will offer suggestions based on complexity of the meal (weeknight cooking vs. weekend), votes/preferences of all attendees and the time since this dish was last prepared (or restaurant was last visited).
